              "[\"we know humans learn from their pastexperiencesand machines follow instructions givenby humansbut what if humans can train themachines to learn from the past data anddo what humans can do and much fasterwell that's called machine learning butit's a lot more than just learning it'salso about understanding and reasoningso today we will learn about the basicsof machine learningso that's paul he loves listening to newsongshe either likes them or dislikes thempaul decides this on the basis of thesong's tempogenreintensity and the gender of voice forsimplicity let's just use tempo andintensity for now so here tempo is onthe x axis ranging from relaxed to fastwhereas intensity is on the y axisranging from light to soaring we seethat paul likes the song with fast tempoand soaring intensity while he dislikesthe song with relaxed tempo and lightintensity so now we know paul's choiceslet's say paul listens to a new songlet's name it as song a song a has fasttempo and a soaring intensity so it liessomewhere here looking at the data canyou guess whether paul will like thesong or not correct so paul likes thissong by looking at paul's past choiceswe were able to classify the unknownsong very easily right let's say nowpaul listens to a new song let's labelit as song b so song blies somewhere here with medium tempoand medium intensity neither relaxed norfast neither light nor soaring now canyou guess whether paul likes it or notnot able to guess whether paul will likeit or dislike it are the choices unclearcorrect we could easily classify song abut when the choice became complicatedas in the case of song b yes and that'swhere machine learning comes in let'ssee how in the same example for song bif we draw a circle around the song b wesee that there are four votes for likewhereas one would for dislike if we gofor the majority votes we can say thatpaul will definitely like the songthat's all this was a basic machinelearning algorithm also it's called knearest neighbors so this is just asmall example in one of the many machinelearning algorithms quite easy rightbelieve me it is but what happens whenthe choices become complicated as in thecase of song b that's when machinelearning comes in it learns the databuilds the prediction model and when thenew data point comes in it can easilypredict for it more the data better themodel higher will be the accuracy thereare many ways in which the machinelearns it could be either supervisedlearning unsupervised learning orreinforcement learning let's firstquickly understand supervised learningsuppose your friend gives you onemillion coins of three differentcurrencies say one rupee one euro andone dirham each coin has differentweights for example a coin of one rupeeweighs three grams one euro weighs sevengrams and one dirham weighs four gramsyour model will predict the currency ofthe coin here your weight becomes thefeature of coins while currency becomesthe label when you feed this data to themachine learning model it learns whichfeature is associated with which labelfor example it will learn that if a coinis of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coinlet's give a new coin to the machine onthe basis of the weight of the new coinyour model will predict the currencyhence supervised learning uses labeleddata to train the model here the machineknew the features of the object and alsothe labels associated with thosefeatures on this note let's move tounsupervised learning and see thedifference suppose you have cricket dataset of various players with theirrespective scores and wickets taken whenyou feed this data set to the machinethe machine identifies the pattern ofplayer performance so it plots this datawith the respective wickets on thex-axis while runs on the y-axis whilelooking at the data you'll clearly seethat there are two clusters the onecluster are the players who scoredhigher runs and took less wickets whilethe other cluster is of the players whoscored less runs but took many wicketsso here we interpret these two clustersas batsmen and bowlers the importantpoint to note here is that there were nolabels of batsmen and bowlers hence thelearning with unlabeled data isunsupervised learning so we sawsupervised learning where the data waslabeled and the unsupervised learningwhere the data was unlabeled and thenthere is reinforcement learning which isa reward based learning or we can saythat it works on the principle offeedback here let's say you provide thesystem with an image of a dog and ask itto identify it the system identifies itas a cat so you give a negative feedbackto the machine saying that it's a dog'simage the machine will learn from thefeedback and finally if it comes acrossany other image of a dog it will be ableto classify it correctly that isreinforcement learning to generalizemachine learning model let's see aflowchart input is given to a machinelearning model which then gives theoutput according to the algorithmapplied if it's right we take the outputas a final result else we providefeedback to the training model and askit to predict until it learns i hopeyou've understood supervised andunsupervised learning so let's have aquick quiz you have to determine whetherthe given scenarios uses supervised orunsupervised learning simple rightscenario one facebook recognizes yourfriend in a picture from an album oftagged photographsscenario 2 netflix recommends new moviesbased on someone's past movie choicesscenario 3 analyzing bank data forsuspicious transactions and flagging thefraud transactions think wisely andcomment below your answers moving ondon't you sometimes wonder how ismachine learning possible in today's erawell that's because today we havehumongous data available everybody isonline either making a transaction orjust surfing the internet and that'sgenerating a huge amount of data everyminute and that data my friend is thekey to analysis also the memory handlingcapabilities of computers have largelyincreased which helps them to processsuch huge amount of data at hand withoutany delay and yes computers now havegreat computational powers so there area lot of applications of machinelearning out there to name a few machinelearning is used in healthcare wherediagnostics are predicted for doctor'sreview the sentiment analysis that thetech giants are doing on social media isanother interesting application ofmachine learning fraud detection in thefinance sector and also to predictcustomer churn in the e-commerce sectorwhile booking a gap you must haveencountered surge pricing often where itsays the fair of your trip has beenupdated continue booking yes please i'mgetting late for officewell that's an interesting machinelearning model which is used by globaltaxi giant uber and others where theyhave differential pricing in real timebased on demand the number of carsavailable bad weather rush r etc so theyuse the surge pricing model to ensurethat those who need a cab can get onealso it uses predictive modeling topredict where the demand will be highwith the goal that drivers can take careof the demand and search pricing can beminimized great hey siri can you remindme to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'llremind youthanks no problem comment below someinteresting everyday examples around youwhere machines are learning and doingamazing jobs so that's all for machinelearning basics today from my site keepwatching this space for more interestingvideos until then happy learning\",\n",
              " \"artificial intelligence and machinelearning what's the difference are theythe same well some people kind of framethe question this way it's AI versus mlis that the right way to think of thisor is it AIequalsmlor is it AI is somehow somethingdifferent than mlso here's three equationsI wonder which one is going to be rightwell let's talk about this first of allwhen we talk about AI I think it'simportant to come with definitionsbecause a lot of people have differentideas of what this is so I'm going toassert the simple definition that AI isbasically exceeding or matchingthe capabilities of a human so we'retrying to match the intelligencewhatever that means and capabilities ofa human subjectnow what could that involve there's anumber of different things for instanceone of them is the ability to discoverto find out new information another isthe ability to infer to read ininformation from other sources thatmaybe has not been explicitly stated andthen also the ability to reasonthe ability to figure things out I putthis and this together and I come upwith something else so I'm going tosuggest to you this is what AI is andthat's the definition we'll use for thisdiscussion now what kinds of things thenwould be involved if we were talkingabout doing machine learning wellMachine learning I'm going to put thatover here is basically a capabilitywe'll start with a Venn diagram machinelearning involves predictions ordecisions based on data think about thisas a very sophisticated form ofstatistical analysis it's looking forpredictions based upon information thatwe have so the more we feed into thesystem the more it's able to give usaccurate predictions and decisions basedupon that data it's something thatlearns that's the L part rather thanhaving to be programmed when we programa system I have to come up with all thecode and if I wanted to do somethingdifferent I have to go change the codeand then get a different outcome in themachine learning situation what I'mdoing could be adjusting some models butis different than programming and mostlyit's learning the more data that I giveto it so it's based on large amounts ofinformation and there's a couple ofdifferent fields within couple ofdifferent types there is supervisedmachine learning and as you might guessthere's an unsupervised machine learningand the main difference as the nameimplies is one has more human oversightlooking at the training of the datausing labels that are superimposed onthe data unsupervised is kind of able torun more uh and and find things thatwere not explicitly statedokay so that's machine learning it turnsout that there's a subfield of machinelearning that we call Deep learningand what is deep learning well thisinvolves things like neural networksneural networks involve nodes andstatistical relationships between thosenodes to model the way that our mindsworkand it's called Deep because we're doingmultiple layers of those neural networksnow the interesting thing about deeplearning is we can end up with some veryinteresting insights but we might notalways be able to tell how the systemcame up with that it doesn't always showits work fully so we could end up withsome really interesting information notknow in some cases how reliable that isbecause we don't know exactly how it wasderived but it's still a very importantpart of all of this realm that we'redealing with so those are two areas andyou can see DL is a subset of ml butwhat about artificial intelligence wheredoes that fit in the Venn diagramand I'm going to suggest to you it isthe superset of mldl and a bunch ofother things what could the other ofthings be well we can involve thingslike natural language processing uh itcould be visionso we want a system that's able to seewe might even want a system that's ableto hear and be able to distinguish whatit's hearing and what it's seeingbecause after all humans are able to dothat and that's part of what our brainsdo is distinguish those kinds of thingsit can involve other things like theability to do text to speechso if we take written words Concepts andbe able to speak those out so this firstone involved being able to see thingsthis is now being able to speak thosethings as welland then other things that humans areable to do naturally that we often takefor granted is motion this is the fieldof Robotics which is a subset of AI theability to just do simple things liketie our shoes open and close the doorlift something walk somewhere that's allsomething that would be part of humancapabilities and involves certain sortsof perceptions calculations that we doin our brains that we don't even thinkabout so here's what it comes down toit's a Venn diagram and we've gotmachine learning We've Got Deep learningand we've got AI so I'm going to suggestto you the right way to think about thisis not these equations those are not theway to look at it in fact what we shouldthink about this as machine learning isa subset of a highand that's how we need to think aboutthis when I'm doing machine learning infact I am doing AI when I'm doing theseother things I'm doing AI but none ofthem are all of AI but they're a veryimportant partthanks for watching please remember tolike this video And subscribe to thischannel so we can continue to bring youcontent that matters to you\"]"

        "# hist=[\"\"\"we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well that's called machine learning but it's a lot more than just learning it's also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so that's paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the\"song's tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity let's just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know paul's choices let's say paul listens to a new song let's name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies\"somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at paul's past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right let's say now paul listens to a new song let's label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear\"correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and that's where machine learning comes in let's see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song that's all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also it's called k nearest neighbors so this is just a\"small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b that's when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning let's first\"quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label\"for example it will learn that if a coin is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin let's give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note let's move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when\"you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the x-axis while runs on the y-axis while looking at the data you'll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no\"labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here let's say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that it's a dog's\"image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model let's see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if it's right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope you've understood supervised and\"unsupervised learning so let's have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies based on someone's past movie choices scenario 3 analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on don't you sometimes wonder how is\"machine learning possible in today's era well that's because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and that's generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are\"a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctor's review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please i'm\"getting late for office well that's an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind\"me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so that's all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy learning\"\"\",\n",
        "# \"\"\"all you need to learn machine learning in 2024 is a laptop and a list of the steps you need to take I'm a student researcher working for an ex meta professor and have had interviews with Google deepmind Amazon and other cool companies but it took me over 3 years to get to this point so today I will share how I would learn machine learning if I could start over by revealing the six key steps you need to take let's get going in general all these steps don't have to be strictly completed in any particular order but I would not start with the final and arguably most important step that said what I do highly recommend is to start with learning the basics of python python is the programming language used by pretty much everyone to work on machine learning and every other step on this list Builds on top of it this mainly applies to beginners that don't know what a list or a dictionary are and that don't know how to write a simple if else statement or a for loop I would even go as far as saying you need to learn on what a list comprehension and what class inheritance are and honestly I don't know what else to say than just type in Python tutorial or course on YouTube or Google and get started there's so much amazing free content out there but you should always keep in Minds to actively code along the tutorial enjoy getting into machine learning with python but don't go too in depth this lets you start with a fun experience because at some point you will also have to learn maths now you could argue that you don't need mouths because so much is already automated and taken care of by cool python libraries which is true but you will need to know all the fundamentals of calculus linear algebra and probability Theory to understand pretty much any machine learning approach that said you really don't need complex maths most of the maths is high school or entry-level College maths like you just need to understand what the derivative of a function is and how to compute it you need to know what a matrix is is and how the dot product works there again are amazing resources out there that are free like these courses right here or a website called Can Academy I mean you can even learn most of what you need on brilliant.org sadly not sponsored or you just go to college and take the mandatory maths classes for any engineering major I'll tell you about my absolute favorite resource for learning the fundamental Maths for new networks after we cover the next important steps this already shows you that you don't need to hustle through all the courses there are in the beginning in fact I wouldn't even recommend that because it can be very frustrating and just not fun whenever you don't understand some maths later on you can always revisit it by just Googling learn the basics and then continue on to the next fun step learning about the ml developer stack so now you know the basics of python and if you haven't already can learn some basic tools like Jupiter notebooks and libraries like pandas numpy and matplot lip numpy is a library for doing mouths with matrices or arrays it's a great starting point because you can now implement the mouths that you just learned about and see how simple it is to compute a DOT product between two matrices met plot lip is a tool for visualizing data and graphs and just seeing what maths you are doing and in my opinion at least visualizing stuff is fun and just very useful finally pandas is a great tool for dealing with data that is in tabular format a lot of machine learning problems deal with tabular data and pandas lets you again very easily manipulate those and visualize the tables all those libraries also work very well with jupyter notebooks and are an essential part of learning machine learning as you will see by getting to know those Frameworks you will automatically improve your overall practical Python and ml skills but again only focus on the basics by following a few tutorials later when working on projects you'll really get to know the libraries so now let's get back to some Theory and finally actually learn about machine learning and deep learning okay up until now everything should honestly not take too long perhaps a few weeks depending on how much time you put in and at what level you already are but the ml courses I will now recommend do take some time the best and probably most famous machine learning course or collection of courses is the machine learning specialization by Andrew Nung the cool thing is that you here already get to know some machine learning Frameworks like psyched learn and tensorflow well I do have to admit I personally prefer and would recommend py Toge but learning one framework pretty much lets you already quickly adapt to the other one this course is absolute gold and it's free although this is the beginner course it is still very important they here teach a lot of classical ml Concepts and those are the things you need to be able to answer quite easily in ml interviews now remember when I teased my favorite resource for learning maths in neural networks well after learning about those in Andrew's course I would watch Andre kathi's neural network series he here implements a simple NLP model from the ground up and goes all the way up to a transform model he also goes through all the mths of back propagation and so on I cannot recommend this series enough since in Andrew NS and Andre kath's courses you already get some practical experience with the taught ml Concepts I would then continue on to the next more advanced and practical course the Deep learning specialization this course focuses more on implementing and training new Nets and the absolutely amazing thing here is that they also include hugging face which is a library that you pretty much cannot avoid it's really amazing and if you feel like this course doesn't teach you enough about hugging face you can also just go through the hugging face NLP course directly there you also learn even more advanced concepts in NLP well if you are interested in NLP that is so yeah those are the two or perhaps even three courses I would take and recommend by now you have learned a lot and worked on several smaller projects or rather tutorials now it's time to actually get your hands dirty and work on real projects I honestly think you here learn the most and there are two things I would work on first I would go to kagle and just work on challenges there are many available for any level try not to underestimate the complexity and start with simpler challenges so you don't get frustrated and demotivated and if you do take on more difficult ones that also come with prize money don't expect to win one it's really difficult to get to that point and you also need a lot of compute so okay after working on kegle challenges comes my final and favorite type of project to work on reimplementing a paper and recreating the results this is challenging and you will learn a lot and most importantly this type of project will definitely help you stand out on your ml application that said there are a few other simpler ways to stand out that you can already get started during your learning process so I'm sure you might want to watch this video right here where I reveal those techniques and tips bye-bye\"\"\",\n",

        "# today's video If you prefer video learning there is this really good introduction to python from free code camp and if you're into text or reading textbooks so me personally I'm not that into textbooks because it makes me really bored easily but I have heard that this book automate the boring stuff is a really good introduction I want you to especially focus on understanding apis and how to use them because that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next\n",
        "# we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash course on large language models which is super beginner friendly like you don't even need to know how to code but if you're into videos this is a 1-hour introduction to large language models by Andre karthy who is an expert in this field next up we're going to do this course on prompt engineering for developers this course is only an hour long and is completely free from\n",

        "# link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental\n",

        "# favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happenthese are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptivestatistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my all-time favorite techdata YouTuber Josh starmer He is very short attention span friendly because how can you possibly get bored of someone singing about math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if youwant something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking abouthow to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learningJosh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having moreexperiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powerschat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go alittle bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I givea lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk alittle bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank you brilliant I've already mentioned them a few times especially for short attention span friends because they're so interactive brilliant actually only specializ izes and stem subjects so that they're able to make the best courses to teach these subjects I personally love using brilliant whenever I want to learn new things and brush up on different skills especially the math and stats part I get so bored when I try to just like watch a video or do some courses umso just you know having those like little interactive things helps a lot in my understanding they have Timeless course offerings like math and stats programming and python as well as new course offerings like the neuron networks courses for the Deep learning and introduction to large language models you can join a millions of people already learning on brilliant I head on over to this link to get started for free also linked in description if you go through my link the first 200 people will get 20% off in annual membershipall right that is the end of today's video thank you guys all so much for watching let me know in the comments if you're now interested in learning Ai and if you want me to make more videos related to learning AI things I don't know if you guys are into that okay anyways have a wonderful day and I'll see you guys in the next video or live stream\n",
